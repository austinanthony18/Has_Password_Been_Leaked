# Has_Password_Been_Leaked
This Python application provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to check the strength of a password and determine if it has been leaked in any known data breaches. The application uses the tkinter library for the GUI and integrates with the Have I Been Pwned API to check for password leaks.
